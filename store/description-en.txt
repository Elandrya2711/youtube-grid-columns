== DETAILED DESCRIPTION ==

YouTube Grid Columns lets you customize how many video columns appear on YouTube's home page — because one size doesn't fit all screens.

Whether you're on a wide monitor and want to see more videos at a glance, or you prefer a focused view with fewer, larger thumbnails: just drag the slider and you're done.

✦ Simple slider control (1–12 columns)
✦ Changes apply instantly — no page reload required
✦ Settings sync across your devices via your Google account
✦ Lightweight — no ads, no tracking, no external requests
✦ Works on YouTube's home page, subscription feed, and explore page

How to use:
1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. Drag the slider to your preferred number of columns
3. YouTube updates immediately

That's it. No sign-up, no configuration, no clutter.
